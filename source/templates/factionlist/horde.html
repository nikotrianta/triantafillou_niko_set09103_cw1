    <p>The Alliance is a ragtag bunch of races found throughout Azeroth and is comprised of Orcs, Forsaken, Tauren, Trolls, Blood Elves and Goblins. Whilst they are misunderstood and often cast aside, the Horde strives to overcome their diffences and band
        together to win freedom for their people and live within lands that have come to despise them.
