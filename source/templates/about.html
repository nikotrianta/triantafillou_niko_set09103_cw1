<h3>About</h3>
<p class="lead">The purpose of this website is to showcase Jinja2, Python and Flask working in tandem to promote an online directory tailored to my gaming passions. My name is Niko, and this website will include information regarding the current state of the game according
    to my experience, alongside end-game dungeon overviews and the character profiles that I have dedicated my time to playing. </p><br>
<h4>Experience</h4>
<p>I have played MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) fairly exclusively over the last 10 years, ever since I began my online journey with World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. Before I began my MMORPG passion, I was always interested
    in playing video games with friends and family, dating back to the Sega Mega Drive, where my mother and I used to play Desert Storm and Sonic the Hedgehog together.</p>
