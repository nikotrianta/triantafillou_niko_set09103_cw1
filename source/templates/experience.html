<h4>Experience</h4>
<p>I have played MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) fairly exclusively over the last 10 years, ever since I began my online journey with World of Warcraft (WoW): Wrath of the Lich King. Before I began my MMORPG passion, I was always
    interested in playing video games with friends and family, dating back to the Sega Mega Drive, where my mother and I used to play Desert Strike and Sonic the Hedgehog together.</p>

<p>I was initially drawn to WoW due to a real life tragedy that involved a, then, close-friend. To help him cope with an incredibly dark period, he turned to the game and I followed him to help him in any way that I could. We played together regularly, doing
    most group content together - group content is described as playing with up to 5 people in a party - and as we finished levelling our characters we started the end-game grind. This process involved many hours of gathering materials and information
    to enter a raid content together, which is the bread and butter of the World of Warcraft experience for people who want more out of their levelling experience.</p>
<p>I have played many MMORPGs over the years, such as Aion, Rift, and my most revered experience being Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR). To me, SWTOR was the epitome of a true RPG in an MMO setting - the vanilla game was incredibly rich with player driven
    story elements, true fashion and ability customisation, and whilst the game adhered to the modern idealogical group-based balance approach that WoW, and many of its predecessors set, the rich culture, history and setting was so well received because
    of the iconic intellectual property and, arguably, was my most passionate online experience so far.</p>
<p>I made a lot of friends on SWTOR, as unlike WoW, which was a very inclusive experience shared between my closest real-life friends, and I still play with them to this day on various other platforms such as For Honor, Star Wars Battlefront, Heroes of the
    Storm, and most notably WoW.</p>
