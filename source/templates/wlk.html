<h1>Warlock</h1>
<p>Warlocks cast Fire or Shadow magic to damage, dran, or curse their enemy. They summon demons as servants.</p>
<p><b>Role: </b>Ranged Damage</p>
<h2>Asekias</h2>
<p>Asekias is the name of the Warlock I currently play when I am not needed on my Paladin character. Whilst Warlocks are pigeon-holed into one combat role of ranged damage, they come with a myriad of utility, such as summoning portals to transport group
    or raid members, and can create a soulstone that allows for a group or raid member to be resurrected during combat!</p>
