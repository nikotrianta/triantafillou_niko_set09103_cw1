<h1>Monk</h1>
<p>Monks are known for their skill in hand-to-hand fighting, relying on their fists and feet as much as their weapons. Monks can also specialise in calling upon the restorative power of the mists to heal allies.</p>
<p><b>Role: </b>Tank, Healer or Melee Damage</p>
<h2>Aseko</h2>
<p>Aseko is the name of the Monk character that I currently play when a little bit more of diversity is required for my Guild's raids. Monks excell in healing where Paladins cannot, and so this characters value is quite favoured for certain encounters.</p>
